User Location Management System

This project is a Java application built with Spring Boot and Maven that manages user information and their locations. The application uses Data Transfer Objects (DTO), Java Persistence API (JPA), and SQL for data storage.

Features

	•	DTO Implementation: Learn how to use DTOs for data transfer between layers.
	•	JPA Integration: Easily manage database interactions using JPA.
	•	SQL Database: Store user data and locations in a SQL database.
	•	Spring Boot: Provides a robust framework for rapid application development.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

	•	Java 17 or higher
	•	Maven 3.8.1 or higher
	•	MySQL or any SQL-compatible database
	•	Git
Endpoints

	•	/users: Manage user data with CRUD operations.
	•	/locations: Retrieve location information associated with users.

DTOs

The application uses DTOs to transfer data between different layers of the application, promoting a clear separation of concerns.

JPA and SQL

	•	JPA is used to interact with the SQL database, making it easier to perform CRUD operations without directly writing SQL queries.
	•	The SQL database stores user details, including their locations.
